# AI Collaboration Evidence: Express.js API Documentation

## Step 1: AI Prompt

**Prompt given to AI:**

```
Explain what body-parser middleware does in Express.js. Include how to use it and whether it's still needed in modern Express.
```
## Step 2: AI’s Response (Summary)

The AI explained:

- `body-parser` middleware parses the body of incoming requests and exposes it under `req.body`.
- In older versions of Express (<4.16.0), `body-parser` needed to be installed and required.
- In modern Express (>=4.16.0), `express.json()` and `express.urlencoded()` replace `body-parser`.
- Sample code was included for both old and new usage.

```js
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

In Express 4.16.0 and later, the same functionality is included directly in Express:
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

So in modern Express applications, you do not need to install body-parser separately — just use express.json() and express.urlencoded() instead.

## Step 3: Evaluation and Corrections

- The explanation was mostly correct.
- **AI did not mention** that the `body-parser` package is still used in some legacy projects.
- I ensured that my API project uses the modern method with `express.json()` and `express.urlencoded()`.
- I added a version note to the documentation explaining the change since Express v4.16.

**Updated Middleware Usage in My Code:**

```javascript
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
```

**README Note:**
> "Uses express.json() and express.urlencoded() to parse incoming request bodies. No need for body-parser in Express v4.16+."


## Final Outcome

- Clear documentation with modern middleware usage.
- AI helped draft technical docs, which I then corrected for accuracy.
- Screenshots/recording available showing prompts, responses, and changes.
